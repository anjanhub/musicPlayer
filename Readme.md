Welcome to my music player.

=> When you run the application hundred song names would be read from a CSV file and would be displayed to the user in the alphabetical order.

=> The user would have four options:-
    1) Play
    2) Shuffle
    3) Previous
    4) Next

=> Select option 1 for playing the songs
    -> The songs start playing in alphabetical order
    -> Select option 3 to play previous song
    -> Select option 4 to play next song

=> Select option 2 for shuffling the songs and playing
    -> The playlist will start playing songs from shuffled list
    -> For shuffling the playlist Fisher Yates Algorithm has been used
    -> When the songs are being played in the shuffle mode the user will have an option of unshuffle
       which plays the songs from unsuffled list of songs

=> When the user reaches the end of the playlist and try to play next song a message would
   be displayed stating "You have reached the end of the playlist"

=> When the user reaches the starting of the playlist and try to play previous song a message would
   be displayed stating "You have reached the starting of the playlist"

=> Fisher Yates Algorithm
    Fisher–Yates shuffle (named after Ronald Fisher and Frank Yates)algorithm, also known as the
    Knuth shuffle (after Donald Knuth), for generating a random permutation of a finite set—in plain terms,
    for randomly shuffling the set.
